# VIDEO CONCATENATOR CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Target resolution for output video
# Options: 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4k, source
# "source" keeps the resolution of the first video
# Note: Most Telegram videos are 480-720p, so 720p is usually sufficient
target_resolution: 720p

# Target frames per second
# Common values: 24 (film), 30 (standard), 60 (smooth)
target_fps: 30

# Aspect ratio for output video
# Options: 16:9, 4:3, 21:9, source
# Videos will be padded with black bars if needed
aspect_ratio: "16:9"

# Video codec for encoding
# libx264 is widely compatible and good quality
video_codec: libx264

# Audio codec
audio_codec: aac

# Audio bitrate
audio_bitrate: 192k

# CRF (Constant Rate Factor) - quality setting
# Range: 0-51 (0 = lossless, 51 = worst)
# Recommended values:
#   18 = visually lossless (large files)
#   23 = high quality (default for x264)
#   26 = good quality (smaller files)
#   28 = acceptable quality (much smaller)
# For Telegram videos (typically 300-700 Kbps sources), 26 is plenty
crf: 26

# Encoding preset - speed vs compression tradeoff
# Options: ultrafast, fast, medium, slow, veryslow
# Faster = larger file, slower = smaller file (same quality)
# "medium" is a good balance, "slow" for smaller files
preset: medium

# Video file extensions to process

  - .mp4
  - .avi
