# Detection confidence threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
# Only detections above this confidence are recorded
# Lower = more detections (may include false positives)
# Higher = fewer detections (may miss some content)
threshold: 0.4

# Video file extensions to process
video_extensions:
  - .mp4

# MODEL CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# NudeNet model settings
# model_path: path to custom .onnx model (leave empty for default 320n)
# model_resolution: must match model (320 for 320n, 640 for 640m)

# TIMESTAMP GENERATION - UNSAFE CRITERIA
# =============================================================================
# These settings control what is considered "unsafe" when generating
# timestamp ranges. You can change these and re-run timestamp generation
# without re-analyzing videos.

# Labels to consider unsafe
# Any second with ANY of these labels (above unsafe_threshold) is marked unsafe
#
# Available labels:
#   FEMALE_GENITALIA_COVERED  - Covered female genitalia
#   FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED  - Exposed female genitalia
#   FEMALE_BREAST_EXPOSED     - Exposed female breasts
#   BUTTOCKS_EXPOSED          - Exposed buttocks
#   ANUS_EXPOSED              - Exposed anus
#   MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED    - Exposed male genitalia
#   MALE_BREAST_EXPOSED       - Exposed male chest
#   FACE_MALE                 - Male face detected
unsafe_labels:
  - FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED
  - MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED
  - ANUS_EXPOSED

# Minimum confidence for a label to count as "detected" for timestamp purposes
# This can be different from the analysis threshold
# Example: analyze with 0.4 threshold, but only mark unsafe if confidence >= 0.6
unsafe_threshold: 0.5

# Merge unsafe ranges that are closer than N seconds apart
# Helps avoid many tiny cuts for flickering detections
# Set to 0 to disable merging
merge_gap: 2
